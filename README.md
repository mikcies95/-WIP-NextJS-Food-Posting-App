## [WIP] Next.js Twitter-esque App

This is an advanced project made by using Next.js with Node. It's main purpose in theory is to create a platform where food-enjoyer can share their recipes for great food. 
It has been built as a part of Udemy course lead by Maximillian Schwarzmuller. 

When you open a page, you should see an app as below:

### How to navigate?

You navigate the page by pressing the buttons in the top-right corner or the ones in the middle of a page.

First button leads you to the page that allows you to browse the meals made by "community".

You may add your own meals, as seen below. You just need to write the necessary input and add an image.

### Current problems / future to-do-list.

- In theory this app should allow for storing images locally and while it does add the posts it's not displaying the added images. /To fix 

- Additionally this App has no advanced back-end utility and one day I would like to add it. For example, building something that allows
storing the posts and images on a server-side database. /Long future plans
